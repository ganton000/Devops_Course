terraform state list # gets resource names within recent state
terraform state show <name_of_resource.logical_resource_name>
terraform show -json # json format of terraform resources
terraform init # installs providers within script

###
terraform console # can access any resource within terraform deployment (great for testing or accessing information)

example command in the console: data.aws_availability_zones.available
Will output available AZs in region.

Can use length() function to get total number available:
length(data.aws_availability_zones.available)

## parsing json
terraform show -json | jq ."values"."root_module"."resources"[0]."values"."cidr_block"

## to remove quotes from jq output, pass in -r flag
terraform show -json | jq -r ."values"."root_module"."resources"[0]."values"."cidr_block"

## modularizing variables from your tf template
- generally create a variables.tf outlining the type and name of variables
- could set default as value or provide the values dynamically via .tfvar and terrform cli
- a .tfvar file will act as a key = value mapping for variable name to its value. This file will be passed in command line as such:

terraform apply -var-file="<file_name>.tfvars"

## example of parsing id from resource's state response
terraform state show aws_vpc.terraform-vpc | grep "id"

## tells if resources are changed or destroyed or added.
terraform plan


## can add lifecycle {} to resources to indicate how to treat currently existing resources prior to deleting/replacing and adding new ones.

an example is:

resource "resource_type" "logical_name" {
	lifecycle {
		create_before_destroy = true
	}
}

this will create the new resource before destroying the current one, eliminating any errors that may be caused by other resources that depend on the currently existing one.

## accessing variables in terraform console
The console looks for the vars only in terraform.tfvars file!

can access locals via: local. keyword
